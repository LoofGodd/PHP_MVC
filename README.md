# MVC Assignment Project
I have developed this website using the MVC pattern in PHP for my teacher.

# Setup
1. Firstly, create a virtual host (vhost) with the DocumentRoot set to the absolute path of the project. For example, /..AbsolutePath/src.
2. Secondly, import the provided database file into phpMyAdmin.
   
If you encounter any issues, I'm uncertain about the specific problems you may face. However, if you have some familiarity with XAMPP, you should be able to resolve them easily.

Note: I utilized XAMPP for this project.

## Flow
When a client sends a request to the server with a specific route, the route determines the appropriate controller. The controller then interacts with the view and model to display information to the users.

## Features
1. Route handling
2. Query parameter helper functions
3. Image helper functions
4. CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
## Requirements
1. PHP 8
2. Composer
3. MySQL
   
**If you are using XAMPP (recommended), LAMPP, or WAMPP, you only need Composer.**

Please ensure that you have PHP 8 and Composer installed to meet the project's requirements. Additionally, MySQL is necessary for database operations.
